			<h3 class="margin-tb-10">PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
			<p class="margin-b-10">Hobbies are of different kinds and it is one that you would be loving and enjoying to do the most. 
			Of all the hobbies that we see and hear, I love Photography the best.
             <br>
           Photography is an art and it just captures the beauty of the moment in all its best.
           Though it does not require great skills, it does require an understanding to capture wonderful shots.</br></p>
			<p class="margin-b-10">Photography has always been one of my favorite hobbies.
			When I take pictures, it’s like seeing things in a new perspective literally and figuratively
			you can go up to a flower and see the texture of the petal or put a caterpillar on your finger and see the little hairlike things on it’s body. 
			Thing about the camera and the lens is that it lets you see people, places, etc. 
			in a whole new perspective and it helps to see things from a different view.
			From photography, I realized that getting a different view of things means you have a more open mind to the world</p>
			<p class="margin-b-10">Photography allows you to create images of events, times, and places. 
			To both record what happened and allow you to share them with friends and family, either in digital format or more permanently with prints or photo books. 
			By being able to capture a special moment in time, you carry the memory of that event forward with you,
			allowing you to share it and remember it with those that were there. 
			Those memories become part of your history, perhaps family lore, 
			not just stories passed down through the generations – but images as well.</p>

			<p class="margin-t-20">So much fun can be had with a camera.
			You could be out with the family at the beach or a picnic, local sports games, 
			randomly roaming your city streets photographing strangers without them noticing, stalking wildlife, hiking up a mountain for a stunning view, 
			or standing under the stars at 2 a.m. watching the Milky Way slowly move across the heavens. So many opportunities to do new, 
			interesting, and fun things with your camera that you likely may not have otherwise done.</p>

			<p class="margin-t-10">The value of the image is determined by its color, its uniqueness, charm, and also practical meaning. 
			If the power of the photograph is so great, that it can make people think over something, 
			or compare or connect themselves with the objects depicted on it, it is regarded as a very valuable thing.
			We need to remember, that every image has a story to tell, and it shouldn’t be neglected.</p>
